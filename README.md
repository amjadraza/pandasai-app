📖PANDASAI APP
</h1>

An App to interact with Pandas Dataframes using Generative AI (LLMs). This app is built using `streamlit`
as front end and using [`pandasai`](https://github.com/gventuri/pandas-ai) a higher level python wrapper to make dataframes conversational.

`pandasai` made available `openai`, `HuggingFace` and `Azure` APIs for Generative AI capabilities. 
User can configure their choice of Platform for backend.  

## 🔧 Features

- Upload csv 📁(csv) and ask questions about the uploaded Data.
- Ask Questions about the data
- Interact with your data like a Human

## 💻 Running Locally

1. Clone the repository📂

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amjadraza/pandasai-app.git
```

2. Install dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and activate virtual environment🔨

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

2B. Using `uv` Package Manager to prepare the virtual environment

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> `uv` package managere is ultra fast. 

3. Run the Streamlit server🚀

```bash
cd pandasai_app
streamlit run main.py 
```

Run App using Docker
--------------------
This project includes `Dockerfile` to run the app in Docker container.

Build the docker container

``docker  build -t pandasai-app .``

1. Run the docker container directly 

``docker run -d --name pai_app -p 8501:8501 pandasai-app``

2. Run the docker container using docker-compose (Recommended)

``docker-compose up``

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

- [ ] Add support for more models (e.g.HuggingFace, Azure.).
- [ ] Adding Functionality of Plotting.
- [ ] Some Generic insights on Uploaded Data (e.g Shape, head etc)
- [x] Adding Docker Support to run the App in Docker
- [ ] Push Docker Image to DockerHub for Public use
- [ ] Deploying App on Google App Engine
